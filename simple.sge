#
#  All jobs require a mem_tokens resource request, set to the approximate amount
#  of memory required.  In the case of multi-process jobs, this is the amount
#  of memory required by one process, not by the job as a whole.  For example,
#  a job needing 1 GB of memory would set mem_tokens=1G below.
#
#  Lines starting #$ contain directives to GE, which tell it how to run the job.
#  Other lines starting # are comments, and are ignored by GE.

#$ -N Test                     # Name of the job
#$ -q college.q                 # Queue in which to run job
#$ -l mem_tokens=1G               # 1 GB memory
#$ -cwd                           # Run in current working directory
#$ -o out-$JOB_ID.log             # File to which standard output should be sent, with job number in filename
#$ -e err-$JOB_ID.log             # File for standard error, with job nubmer in filename
